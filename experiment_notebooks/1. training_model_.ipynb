              " ('islamabad: following its approval from national assembly, the lower house of the parliament, the upper house senate on wednesday also passed the gas infrastructure development cess (gidc) bill 2015 amid protest from some opposition members.during the discussion, members of opposition parties criticized the government for presenting the bill in the house and urged that it should be presented in council of common interest (cci) for consultation with the provinces before its passage. senator tahir hussain mashhadi of mqm said that the the bill should have been presented in the cci. he said any tax on natural resources cannot be imposed without consultation of provinces, he said.senator nauman wazir and sentor saleem mandviwala called for need to find a mechansim of gas infrastructure development and suggested that concerns of opposition should also be addressed.opposition leader aitzaz ahsan and senators including usman saifullah, mohsin aziz, shahi syed, saeed ghani, usman kakar, sassui paleejo, robina adnan, naseema ehsan and mohsin leghari registered their opposing comments on the bill during discussion.opposition members belonging to muttahida qaumi movement (mqm), pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (pti), awami national party (anp) and balochistan national awami party staged a token walk out from the house.earlier, minister for petroleum and natural resources shahid khaqan abbasi in his winding up speech said national assembly has already passed the bill and said the government requires rs1000 billion annually to maintain and improve gas infrastructure in the country.he said that rs100 billion would be collated annually through this levy and it would be used for gas infrastructure and added that no province is self-sufficient in gas.he said that the production of gas is 4 bcfd and demand is 8 bcfd adding that it is very necessary to fund some important projects.he said that tapi is rs1 trillion project but our share is of rs100 billion.the minister said that the collection amount of gidc would not be misused and the parliament would oversee it.shahid khaqan said that the cci itself says that the gidc does not come into its domain and federal government should settle it. he said that supreme court has already decided that it is not a tax but a cess.defending further the cess bill, he argued that to bridge the widening gas supply gap a number of gas import projects were being perused including the iran-pakistan (ip) gas pipeline project, turkmenistan-afghanistan-pakistan-india (tapi) pipeline project, lng import projects and lpg supply enhancement project in public as well as private sectors.he said that in case the required infrastructure was not developed for the above mentioned projects the government would be forced to import liquefied fuels which are much costlier as compared to gas.further pakistan would also be exposed to payment of liquidated damages or payments. according to him presently neither the federal government nor any gas utility has adequate funding to implement the above project.to create the required infrastructure it was therefore necessary that a new cess may be imposed.he also accepted the idea of some opposition senators for forming a committee to point out anomalies in the bill, which would prepare its recommendations to make the bill more beneficial.the minister went on to say that it would be the current government, which has planned to provide gas to every district of balochistan\\x96 app/geo news \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

just a quarter of a percentage point - was enough to trigger a convulsion in world markets that led to the worst start to a year for global stocks since world war two.underlining \\'cause and effect\\', the subsequent recovery only came about once the federal reserve hastily made clear it was pressing the pause button precisely because of seismic events in world finance.few doubt a growing u.s. economy that\\'s near full employment can absorb some normalization of interest rates from near zero, and a higher dollar goes hand in hand with that.but the rest of the world clearly can\\'t.the bank for international settlements estimates that while u.s. dollar dominance means it accounts for almost 90 percent of all foreign exchange transactions and some 60 percent of hard currency reserves. but crucially it also accounts for about 60 2022 aug-01 14:44 percent of all debts and assets outside the united states.and if the rest of the world goes into shock because of the higher cost of servicing and paying back those dollar debts, the boomerang effect on u.s. exporters, commodity firms and the wider economy just ends up tying the fed\\'s hands in ways made crystal clear this year already.strong>ambivalence</strongno surprise, then, the u.s. central bank has no deep love for the dollar\\'s prime reserve currency status - even though it\\'s been described by europeans and others over the years as an \"exorbitant privilege\" that ensures the world lends to the u.s. treasury in its own currency at low interest rates regardless of dollar strength.speaking at an event in zurich on tuesday on the dollar\\'s global status, new york fed chief bill dudley said americans should not be perturbed if other currencies such as the euro or china\\'s yuan eventually eat into the dollar\\'s share of reserves.\"if other countries\\' currencies emerge to gain stature as reserve currencies, it is not obvious to me that the united states loses,\" he said, as long as it \"is being driven by their progress, rather than by the u.s. doing a poorer job.\"while that\\'s far from wishing away dollar hegemony, it speaks to the greater ambivalence among central bankers toward reserve status than their national treasury chiefs - given how widespread use of the currency can compromise domestic policy.it\\'s that tension that risks sowing instability everywhere.if the fed can\\'t adjust monetary policy because of fears of transmitting a self-defeating shockwave around the world via the dollar, then there\\'s understandable concern that artificially low fed policy just stores up even more debt and international accounting imbalances and undermines the very currency that\\'s supposed to play anchor.at the same event in zurich, claudio borio, head of the monetary and economic department of the bis, said the dollar\\'s role could potentially exacerbate instability by allowing the united states to run larger and more persistent fiscal and current account deficits - and to run looser monetary policy for longer.what\\'s more, a resulting fed easing bias spreads to developed and emerging economies as governments resist a weaker dollar for competitiveness or financial stability reasons, borio added.\"easing begets easing,\" he said.for morgan stanley, this is just leads to ever-higher debt, and there are no painless ways out of a problem that will start to hurt significantly over the coming years - only a series of \"less painful\" options including the option of consolidating debts and making them permanent or perpetual.in the meantime, the u.s. bank said, the dollar itself will most likely push higher again, if only because the u.s. economy is probably the only one that can absorb a rising exchange rate in this environment.for borio, a more \\'pluralistic\\' system with many world currencies sharing the reserve role doesn\\'t by itself solve any problem, either. there would then be no credible single anchor.hard-headed cooperation and joint decision making may be the only answer.\"this means not just putting one\\'s house in order, but also putting our global village in order.\"',\n",

(but) then there was the advent of shale. since that period, there is a realization that there is no scarcity of oil.\"the shale revolution turned the united states into one of the world\\'s biggest oil producers, at a time when exporters in the middle east and russia were also pumping out record volumes, causing oil prices lcoc1 to more than halve since mid-2014 to under $50 per barrel.the fpso opportunity, which has been laid up for over two years, was built in 1972 and operated by chevron cv.n and australia\\'s woodside petroleum (wpl.ax) before being taken over by a bermuda-registered fpso opportunity inc in 2011. the newest owner could not be reached for comment.new landscapethe growing number of vessels anchored in the johor river estuary is changing the landscape for the locals.\"i\\'ve been coming here to fish every day for 10 years, and never have there been more ships parked,\" said an angler named aiman, sitting on an unused pipeline lying on the beach.\"it is quite intimidating to come here before dawn and to find, with the first rays of sun, another big ship has been parked here,\" he added, with his line dangling in the river.and it\\'s not just malaysia that has become the dumping ground for idled oil equipment.across the singapore strait, in the bays of indonesia\\'s batam island, over a hundred oil drilling and support vessels have been sitting idle for months, or even years.while laying up ships is legal and even provides profit to specialist mothballing companies, environmental groups say the growing number adds to the risk to flora and fauna.\"the idling oil tankers risk polluting the marine environment, which a sizable population of the riverine fishermen rely on for their living,\" said vincent chow, chairman of the malaysian nature society in johor, citing the threat of dissolving paint and potential leakage of heavy metals and fuel into the sea.strong>cost of doing nothing</strongthe armada of laid-up vessels shows how the shale boom caught the oil industry off guard and scuppered plans to drill for new fields.energy consultancy wood mackenzie said global exploration spending halved in 2015, while bmi research sees capital expenditure among oil producers suffering another sharp decline this year.struggling drilling companies are paying to lay up rigs in the hope they will survive until demand picks up again.the cost depends on size and location, and whether they are in a so-called \"hot lay-up\", whereby equipment is kept operational so the vessel quickly returns to service, or \"cold lay-up\" whereby ships can be mothballed for years.cold lay-up for a rig or large oil tanker costs $20,000 to $25,000 a month in johor, said balasubramanian krishna, operations manager at malaysian lay-up specialist ocean shipcare, while laying-up a small supply vessel costs $3,000 to $4,000 a month.matti bargfried, head of marketing at maritime software company codie, said a lay-up time of several years could make re-commissioning lengthy and costly.\"the main concern here is preservation against humidity, leakage of chemicals and condition of the hull,\" he said.this means that some of the idled vessels may have to be scrapped in yards in countries such as india or bangladesh, although shippers say the current cost of the journey may be more than their scrap value.',\n",
