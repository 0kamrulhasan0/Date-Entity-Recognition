Opinion polls before Election Day had given Clinton a slim lead.Mexico\'s peso plunged to its lowest-ever levels as Trump\'s chances of winning the presidency increased. Concerns of a Trump victory have weighed heavily on the peso for months because of his threats to rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico and tax money sent home by migrants to pay to build a wall on the southern U.S. border.Trump surged to wins in Florida, Ohio, Iowa and North Carolina, and Fox News projected a win for him in Wisconsin. With voting completed in 49 of the 50 U.S. states, he also narrowly led in Michigan and New Hampshire, edging him closer to 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the state-by-state fight for the White House.Shortly after Fox called Wisconsin for Trump, supporters at his election evening rally in New York began to chant "Lock her up" - a common refrain on the campaign trail for the former U.S. secretary of state repeatedly dubbed "Crooked Hillary" by Trump.Clinton still had ways to reach 270 electoral votes, but she would have to sweep the remaining battleground states including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada, and pull off an upset win in Arizona.Trump captured conservative states in the South and Midwest, while Clinton swept several states on the East Coast and Illinois in the Midwest.After running close throughout the night in Virginia, Clinton pulled out the swing state that is home to her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine. But TrumpAt 8:55 p.m. EST, Clinton acknowledged a battle that was unexpectedly tight given her edge in opinion polls going into Election Day.She tweeted: "This team has so much to be proud of. Whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything."As of 11:40 p.m. EST, Trump had 244 electoral votes to Clinton\x92s 209, with U.S. television networks projecting the winner in 41 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.A wealthy real-estate developer and former reality TV host, Trump rode a wave of anger toward Washington insiders to challenge Clinton, whose gold-plated establishment resume includes stints as a first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state.strong>UNPOPULAR CANDIDATES</strongBoth candidates had historically low popularity ratings, although Trump\'s were worse than Clinton\'s, in an election that many voters characterized as a choice between two unpleasant alternatives.Before Tuesday\'s voting, Clinton led Trump, 44 percent to 39 percent in the last Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll. A Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation poll gave her a 90 percent chance of defeating Trump and becoming the first woman elected U.S. president.Also at stake on Tuesday was control of Congress. Television networks projected Republicans would retain control of the House of Representatives, where all 435 seats were up for grabs.In the Senate, where Republicans were defending a slim four-seat majority, Democrats scored their first breakthrough in Illinois when Republican Senator Mark Kirk lost re-election. But Republicans Rob Portman in Ohio and Marco Rubio in Florida won high-profile Senate re-election fights.In a presidential campaign that focused more on the character of the candidates than on policy, Clinton, 69, and Trump, 70, accused each other of being fundamentally unfit to lead the country.Trump entered the race 17 months ago and survived a series of seemingly crippling blows, many of them self-inflicted, including the emergence in October of a 2005 video in which he boasted about making unwanted sexual advances on women. He apologized but within days, several women emerged to say he had groped them, allegations he denied.He was judged the loser of all three presidential debates with Clinton and she led him by varying margins for months in opinion polls.Trump won avid support among a core base of white non-college educated workers with his promise to be the "greatest jobs president that God ever created." He has vowed to impose a 35 percent tariff on goods exported to the United States by U.S. companies that went abroad.His volatile nature and unorthodox proposals led to campaign feuds with a long list of people, including Muslims, the disabled, Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, the family of a slain Muslim-American soldier, a Miss Universe winner and a federal judge of Mexican heritage.', {'entities': []}), ("SHARJAH: Cameron Delport slammed his third half-century of the season and picked up three crucial wickets, setting up a four-run win for Lahore Qalandars against Peshawar Zalmi in Sharjah.Chasing a stiff target of 165, Peshawar recovered from a top-order wobble through some big hitting from Dawid Malan, but the team did not have enough to get over the line. However, despite the defeat, other results in the tournament meant that Peshawar were through to the playoffs.Lahore, after being inserted, lost Chris Gayle for a first-ball duck, but Delport put up fifty-plus stands with Azhar Ali (25) and Umar Akmal to seize the advantage.Delport's partnership with Akmal for the third wicket yielded 101 runs; Delport hit six fours and three sixes for his 78, while Akmal's 31-ball 52 featured six fours. Their efforts ensured that Peshawar needed to chase at more than eight an over right from the off.Tamim Iqbal kept the runs flowing for Peshawar with a quick 30, but the team lost wickets in a cluster to soon fall to 95 for 4.Peshawar needed 70 runs from 46 balls at that time, but Malan blew new wind into his team's chase by blasting a 35-ball 42 with three sixes. His blows brought the equation down to 18 off the last two overs, but Malan was trapped lbw by Kevon Cooper off the first ball in the penultimate over, tilting the contest back Lahore's way.Peshawar needed 16 off the last over, and despite a six from Wahab Riaz, they could only muster 160 for 7.

Growth is projected to slow further to 6.3 percent in 2017, ADB said.The bank\'s 2016 forecast for China, down from a December estimate of 6.7 percent, is at the lower end of Beijing\'s own target of 6.5-7 percent as the government presses ahead with painful reforms, though Premier Li Keqiang has vowed that would not lead to a hard landing.Weak prices for oil and other commodities also cast a shadow over the prospects of Asia\'s commodity-dependent economies, the ADB said.In the United States, expanding private consumption and investment will be tempered by weak external demand, the ADB said. US Federal Reserve policymakers have cited continuing risks from a shaky global economy in halving the number of potential interest rate hikes this year to two.Growth in India will slip to 7.4 percent this year from 7.6 percent in 2015, but should recover to 7.8 percent in 2017, the ADB said.For all of South Asia, ADB forecast growth at 6.9 percent in 2016 and 7.3 percent in 2017, versus growth of 7.0 percent last year.Economies in Southeast Asia are projected to expand 4.5 percent this year, from 4.4 percent in 2015, and by 4.8 percent in 2017.For East Asia, ADB sees growth at 5.7 percent in 2016 and 5.6 percent in 2017. The region grew 6.0 percent last year.Central Asia is estimated to expand by 2.1 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2017, following growth of 2.9 percent in 2015, the bank said.Annual inflation in developing Asia is expected to recover to 2.5 percent this year from 2.2 percent in 2015 as domestic demand strengthens, ADB said.

The bidding process starts next month.South Africa´s government has been pushing for more black players to be included in the nation´s most popular sports but more than two decades after the end of apartheid whites still make up the bulk of players in athletics, cricket, netball and rugby."I have therefore resolved to revoke the privilege of Athletics South Africa (ASA), Cricket South Africa (CSA), Netball South Africa (NSA) and South African Rugby (SARU) to host and bid for major and mega international tournaments," Mbalula said in a statement.The soccer federation was the only one of the five to meet its transformation targets, he said.Mbalula said he would review the decision when considering the results on the 2016-17 ´Transformation Barometer´, which could be at the end of next year.

"I fear people will provoke him on and off the field but he has been told to remain calm and do not react," said Alam. "That happened on his first tour (New Zealand) when he was fielding on the boundary line but they die down once you don´t react," said Alam.Fans shouted slogans and a stadium announcer played a sound effect of a cash register before the start of one of Amir´s overs during Pakistan´s tour of New Zealand in January this year -- his first international tour on return.Alam said Amir in particular and other players in general will have to follow a strict code of conduct on the tour."The message is clear for all the players and that is there will be no compromise on discipline and zero tolerance," said Alam, a former Pakistan captain."Amir will have to follow strict code of conduct which stops him from meeting people and focus on cricket," said Alam, who praised Amir´s conduct."Since his return, Amir has been very good and has shown remorse of what he did," said Alam. "People expect miracles from him but he has been very good on the three tours he has had so far and we hope he will deliver to the best of his abilities in England."Alam said Pakistan´s team was up for England´s challenge.

He also developed some problems in his right ankle which is creating a problem for his landing after completing a delivery," he said."He needs some rest to remove the stress. If he continues like this he may collapse any time.

Xinjiang was once a key transportation and trade hub on the ancient Silk Road.During this year\'s annual session of the National People\'s Congress, the Xinjiang delegation proposed the construction of high-speed railways linking the regional capital of Urumqi and southern Xinjiang\'s Kashgar, the starting point of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), as well as another one connecting Urumqi and northern Xinjiang\'s Horgos, a land port on the China-Kazakhstan border.The delegation also proposed starting construction on the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway, which has long been discussed and planned. The national lawmakers from Xinjiang believe it is urgent to start construction on the railway to enhance economic cooperation with the two Central Asian countries.A total of 223 westbound trains carrying construction materials, agricultural produce, garments and other merchandise traveled via nine cross-border routes linking Xinjiang to Central Asian countries in 2016, said Hu Kaijiang, director of the Xinjiang Economic and Information Commission.This year, Xinjiang plans to expand operations to run 400 westbound cross-border trains to facilitate exports of technology and equipment and seek new growth opportunities, Hu said.Geographic location, rich natural resources and preferential policies introduced to encourage opening-up have given Xinjiang advantages in becoming the core area on the economic belt, Shokrat said. Becoming a key player on the economic belt will also benefit the region\'s social development.Besides improving its transportation network, the region will focus on the development of key cities along the economic belt. Xinjiang aims to achieve more than 7 percent economic growth this year and to see "substantial" progress in making the region serve as the transportation, logistic, financial, cultural and medical center on the modern Silk Road, he added.', {'entities': []}), ('strong>WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday of the risk of political isolationism, notably Britain\'s possible exit from the European Union, and the risk of growing economic inequality as it cut its global economic growth forecast for the fourth time in a year.</strongIn the run-up to the annual spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, D.C. this week, the IMF said the global economy was vulnerable to shocks such as sharp currency devaluations and worsening geopolitical conflicts.In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF forecast global economic growth of 3.2 percent this year, compared to a forecast of 3.4 percent in January. The growth estimate also was lowered in July and October of last year.For 2017, the IMF said the global economy would grow 3.5 percent, down 0.1 percentage point from its January estimate.Its latest report cited a worsening spillover from China\'s economic slowdown as well as the impact of low oil prices on emerging markets such as Brazil. It also highlighted persistent economic weakness in Japan, Europe and the United States.The gloomier picture sets the stage for the IMF and the World Bank to call this week for more coordinated global action to support growth."In brief, lower growth means less room for error," IMF\'s chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, told a news conference, adding that "scarring effects" from years of tepid growth could in turn weaken demand, thin the workforce, and reduce potential output further, creating a scenario of "secular stagnation."strong>ISOLATIONISM GROWS</strongIn its report, the IMF warned that the rise of nationalist parties in Europe, the June 23 "Brexit" referendum, and anti-trade rhetoric in the U.S. presidential campaign posed threats to the global economic outlook.A British exit from the EU could do "severe regional and global damage by disrupting established trading relationships," it said."We\'re definitely facing the risk of going into doldrums that could be politically perilous," said Obstfeld, who pointed to stagnant wage growth as fueling a growing sense of economic inequality that is spilling into the voting booth in many countries.The IMF urged policymakers to boost growth with actions such as deregulating certain industries and raising labor market participation. It recommended nations with fiscal breathing room boost investments in infrastructure and cut labor taxes, and it encouraged central banks to keep monetary policy accommodative.The IMF\'s report and the gathering of officials and central bankers in Washington this week comes against the backdrop of widening rows in Europe over negative interest rates, a refugee crisis, and how to shore up Greece\'s financial bailout program.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that the European Central Bank\'s record low interest rates were causing "extraordinary problems" for German banks and pensioners, and risked undermining voters\' support for European integration.Official negotiations over Greece\'s bailout review have been idled during the IMF and World Bank meetings, but the debate over whether to provide more debt relief to Athens in exchange for further budget cuts is expected to continue on the sidelines.Obstfeld repeated the IMF\'s demand for a bailout program that would put Greece on a path to sustain its debt and begin growing again, adding that there should be some flexibility to help its government deal with the massive numbers of refugees who have fled to Greece from war-torn countries.strong>FORECASTS FOR JAPAN, U.S. ALSO CUT</strongThe IMF on Tuesday cut Japan\'s growth forecast for 2016 in half to 0.5 percent. It said Brazil\'s economy would now shrink by 3.8 percent this year versus the previous forecast of a 3.5 percent contraction, as Latin America\'s largest economy struggles through its deepest recession in decades.Meanwhile, the United States, one of the relative bright spots in the global economy, also saw its 2016 growth forecast cut to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent. The IMF said it anticipated an increased drag on U.S. exports from a stronger U.S. dollar, while low oil prices would keep energy investment weak.U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will urge G20 and IMF members to take steps to bolster demand, but also to "avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments and refrain from targeting exchange rates for competitive purposes," a senior Treasury official told reporters.The IMF nudged China\'s growth forecast slightly higher to 6.5 percent this year, and 6.2 percent in 2017, partly due to previously announced policy stimulus moves.

Japanese equity prices surged and inflation also strengthened during this period.Despite Southeast Asian currencies rising against the yen, they mirrored some of these effects, study authors GiovanniGanelli, and Nour Tawk said. "Our results show that implementation of QQE in Japan, when estimated by a positive shock to Japanese equity prices, consistently caused an increase in equity prices across emerging Asian countries, as well as an appreciation of their currencies," they wrote."Most (Southeast Asian) countries experienced an increase in output and a temporary increase in inflation. Capital inflows surged in many countries."They argue that while most existing research uses interest rate changes as proxies for quantitative easing, this transmission channel is broken in Japan because rates have been at the zero bound for an extended period.Instead, they use stock market surges and increases in the monetary base as proxies for QQE.The researchers said that Japan´s QQE caused a significant increase in equity prices in emerging Asia, with increases in the 2 to 5 percent range for China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia.And while nearly all countries surveyed experienced an appreciation of their currencies versus the yen as a result of QQE, it had a "generally positive" impact on growth in emerging Asian countries, with statistically significant increases in<br/> Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.', {'entities': []}), ('strong>BIRMINGHAM: Azhar Ali´s patient century lifted Pakistan to 257 for three and a dominant position on the second day of the third test against England at Edgbaston on Thursday.</strongReplying to the home team´s 297 all out, Azhar shared a second-wicket partnership of 181 with Sami Aslam on the way to an excellent knock of 139 as England endured a frustrating day in the field.Aslam was run out for 82 after being called for a quick single by Azhar who was dropped twice before completing his 10th test century.England made an early breakthrough with the fourth ball of the day when Mohammad Hafeez cut James Anderson straight to Gary Ballance at point and was out for a duck.Anderson induced a rash stroke from Azhar shortly after lunch but Joe Root spilled a difficult catch at second slip and England´s anxiety increased.Azhar, also dropped by Moeen Ali off his own bowling, drove Steven Finn off the back foot for three to bring up his 21st test half century and Aslam, 20, swept spinner Moeen for four to reach his maiden test fifty in his third match.Azhar got to three figures by gloving a Stuart Broad bouncer to the fine leg boundary, celebrating the milestone with 10 press-ups.He continued to punish the England attack, hitting a total of 15 fours and one six, before edging the last ball of the day from Chris Woakes to Alastair Cook at first slip.Younus Khan was unbeaten on 21 at the close.The four-match series is level at 1-1.', {'entities': []}), ('ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will extend financial assistance of 178 million dollars to Pakistan on easy installments for 20 years.The agreement in this regard was signed between Secretary Finance and Country Director ADB here on Thursday.Speaking on the occasion, Finance Secretary Salim Sethi said the amount will be spent on the construction of Gojra-Shorkot motorway.He said the motorway\x92s 62 kilometer section is part of the Pak-China Economic Corridor.

In the medium-term, Pakistan\x92s growth is expected to continue to accelerate, reaching 5 percent in FY17.\x93Pakistan continues to make good progress in restoring macroeconomic stability. Building on this Pakistan needs to push forward with deeper structural reforms that spread benefits more widely, and the World Bank stands ready to support the reforms agenda,\x94 says Illango Patchamuthu, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.Pakistan\x92s growth was driven by domestic consumption that continues to compensate for weak global demand. The report warned that Pakistan\x92s low rates of investment and declining export competitiveness, however, remain a concern.The report said that growth acceleration will depend on the implementation of structural reforms, such as energy and taxation and implementation of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).In the long term, growth will be driven by increased investment in both physical and human capital, with increased focus on better nutrition, health and education outcomes.\x93Pakistan has made significant progress in reducing poverty over the last decade. Based on the revised poverty line adopted in early 2016, the percentage of people living below the poverty line decreased from 64.3 percent in FY02 to 29.5 percent in FY14,\x94 the report said. \x93This reduction in poverty is corroborated when analyzing other data, such as asset ownership\x94, says Muhammad Waheed, Senior Economist and lead author of the report.Projected even higher growth in FY18, the report also expects a moderate increase in investment (related to CPEC projects) will to contribute to an acceleration of growth, which will continue to be driven by public and private consumption.Pakistan\x92s growth in FY16 was driven by strong domestic demand.Consumption accounted for an overwhelming 92 percent of GDP in FY16, and contributed 7 percentage points towards GDP growth, supported by sustained growth in remittances.Strong aggregate demand and improving business sentiments were evident in private sector credit growth of 12 percent, expanding by Rs. 461 billion in FY16 compared with Rs. 224 billion in FY15, the report said. Low inflation and low interest rates also contributed to higher credit growth.\x93The government\x92s efforts to stabilize the macroeconomic environment provided a better footing for economic activity, while marginal improvements in energy supplies facilitated manufacturing growth in particular,\x94 the report added.The World Bank\x92s 2017 Doing Business report found that Pakistan improved four ranks in 2017, placing it among the top ten \x93most improved\x94 countries. Revenue growth is underpinning the falling deficit, driven in FY16 by a 20 percent increase in the Federal Board of Revenue\x92s (FBR) collection.A series of new tax measures in the FY17 budget will broaden the tax base and are expected to contribute to another significant increase in FBR revenues. On the expenditure side, the development budget has grown faster than the recurrent budget.In the FY17 budget, an expected reduction in state-owned enterprise subsidies and interest payments has created space for an increase in infrastructure spending, including on CPEC projects.\xa0\xa0', {'entities': []}), ('strong>LAHORE: Former Pakistan cricket team skipper Inzamamul Haq on Monday assumed charge of the position of chief selector for the national team.</strongAddressing a press conference in Lahore, Inzamamul Haq flanked by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chief Shahyar Khan, said: \x93I will try to justice [to my selection].

Cosmetics accounted for nearly half of the country\'s record duty-free revenue of 5.8 trillion won ($5.1 billion) in the first half of this year, customs data showed.The trade is not without its downside. To counter unofficial re-sales, Korea\'s Customs Service is considering setting a 50 product limit for duty-free buyers, a customs official said.

It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products "BB cream" and "CC cream", South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products."Korean consumers are very sophisticated.

said tax officials are obtaining data of registered motor vehicles above 1,000cc to determine the sources of income of their owners to increase filings of tax returns.They told The News that Inland Revenue asked local car assemblers and customs authorities to share the last five-year data of purchased vehicles with the tax department.\x93We are comparing this with the data provided by the provincial motor vehicle registration authorities,\x94 said a source.The sources said the FBR has started issuing notices to the owners of vehicles and around 422 vehicles have been seized on non-compliance.Motor vehicle registration authorities of various cities have so far shared data of 821,000 registered vehicles above 1,000 CC, while Indus Motors Co Limited, Pak Suzuki Motors Co Ltd and Honda Atlas Motors Ltd have provided the details of 73,200, 153,700 and 45,000 vehicles, respectively.The sources said the customs department will also provide the details of vehicles imported during the past five years, including those cleared under the amnesty scheme announced in 2013.They said a number of smuggled vehicles are being used, especially in rural areas.An official at Regional Tax Office (RTO) Karachi said vehicles were also cleared on fake identity for which customs authorities are responsible.The customs cleared around 51,200 vehicles under the amnesty scheme 2013 and earned the FBR Rs16.2 billion as duty and taxes.\x93The amnesty was granted on clearance and a vehicle owner is required to file income tax returns and declare source of income,\x94 said the source.However, the FBR failed to identify the real ownership due to apathy of customs department fraught with corruption and misconduct.The Federal Tax Ombudsman, in 2014, released a detailed report on irregularities in clearance of imported vehicles.\x93Granting amnesty to smuggling is counterproductive as it promotes smuggling, emboldens smugglers and contributes to black economy,\x94 the report said.It further said luxury vehicles were mostly smuggled to cater to the upper class, adding that therefore the amnesty was more undesirable and against the national interest.\x93Apart from the conceptual irrational and counter-productivity of amnesty for smuggled vehicles, the amnesty scheme 2013 was allegedly misused for corrupt motives by the customs staff for regularising such vehicles as had either not yet arrived in the country or these were not physically presented or actually seized by the customs,\x94 the report said.Besides, many tampered and stolen vehicles might have been granted amnesty due to weak or non-checking of tampering and absence of any filer for stolen vehicles, it said.\x93It will be difficult to cross-match the data of imported vehicles with those registered with the provincial authorities in such as scenario,\x94 said a source in the Inland Revenue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', {'entities': []}), ('strong>Cristiano

(for) international forces has led to abuse by fuel traders which allows them to illegally profit," said a new report by the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (MEC), which was seen by AFP.The report, due to be released on Tuesday, said 20 commercial companies were issued tax-exemption certificates last year.The process to obtain "maafinamas" involves a tightly bureaucratic application system that goes through the US military, NATO and the Afghan finance and foreign ministries -- but the document remains prone to "misuse"."Companies that possess legitimate exemption forms have been known to sell the original to other companies," the report said, explaining how military fuel was ending up in the commercial market."(Also) after the customs department process the exemption paperwork, the companies that have been granted exemption forms re-sell the fuel."NATO said it could not immediately comment, and the interior and defence ministries did not respond to AFP´s queries.Shafiq Qarizada, deputy minister for customs, told AFP he "cannot confirm nor deny" whether exempted fuel is washing up in the commercial market.strong>- ´Contaminated´ -</strongThe comments come ahead of a crucial conference in Brussels in October, where donor countries are expected to reaffirm civilian aid funding for Afghanistan over the next four years.Afghanistan is battling what observers label "donor fatigue" as efforts to replace its huge foreign aid dependency with self-sufficiency are thwarted by corruption and criminal networks imperilling the already weak economy.Misuse of fuel exemptions is killing local businesses in a country that is heavily dependent upon imports to meet its energy needs, two private traders told AFP.The exemption waves off 12 percent customs duty among other charges, officials say."Maafinamas have contaminated the commercial market," said the official who carried out the inspection."How can a trader who dutifully pays taxes compete with cheaper maafinama fuel? This is suffocating lawful businesses and encouraging smuggling of fuel... and resulting in custom revenue losses worth millions."The misuse also has potential military implications.In May last year 17 Afghan policemen were killed when the Taliban stormed their remote base in the mountainous province of Badakhshan.Officials at the time said the policemen were unable to escape because they lacked adequate fuel for their vehicles, raising concern that military fuel was not reaching its intended destination.There are ongoing discussions for a Memorandum of Understanding between NATO and the finance ministry to curb the misuse of maafinamas, multiple sources including Qarizada told AFP.Among various reforms being discussed is a suggestion to levy customs duty on all military fuel and reimburse payments for actual deliveries."MEC understands from interviews with both (NATO) and (finance ministry) that this reform is strongly supported but it is still not implemented," the MEC report said."Why not?

Wage growth, another indicator of economic strength, slowed slightly, bringing the annual pace for the last three months to 2.5 percent, compared with the 12-month rate of 2.6 percent.And the unemployment rate, which is based on a separate database from the job creation numbers, rose by 0.2 percentage points to 4.9 percent, though still near the lowest level in more than eight years.That rise was mainly due to a large jump in the number of people reported rejoining the workforce, diluting the impact of the hiring surge on the jobless rate.In May the unemployment rate had fallen from 5.0 percent to 4.7 percent after the volatile data showed a huge number of people had dropped out of the labor force.\xa0', {'entities': []}), ('MUMBAI: Virat Kohli \x91s explosive batting display helped India set a difficult target for the West Indies \xa0in the second semi-final of the World Twenty20 here at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday night.Sent into bat by the West Indies captain Darren Sammy, India piled up a huge total of 192 runs for the loss of only two wickets with the help of three consecutive sixty-plus partnerships .First, openers Rohit Sharma (43) and Ajinkya Rahane (40)provided a sound start of 62, then Rahane and Kohli added 66 for the second wicket and later Kohli and his captain Mahindra Singh Dhoni made 64 for the unbeaten third wicket stand.\xa0Kohli blasted an unbeaten 89 from 47 balls, hitting eleven fours and a six while Dhoni also remained not out on 15.This is India\x92s second highest total in a World T20 match after 218-4 against England at Durban in 2007.\xa0', {'entities': []}), ('KARACHI: Top seed Aqeel Khan eased into the semifinals of men´s singles event after thrashing his quarterfinal opponent Muzamil Murtaza in straight sets in Modern Club Founder Members National Ranking Tennis Championship here Sunday at Modern Club.Pakistan´s ace tennis player Aqeel Khan found little resistance from his quarterfinal opponent Muzamil and recorded a convincing 6-0, 6-1 triumph. <br/> <br/> In U-14 singles semifinal encounter, Amin Shafi overpowered Rayyan Jawwad in straight sets by 6-2, 6-1 score.In U-12 semifinals, Mohammad Yahya defeated Asher Mir by 8-6 score while Ibrahim Khan beat Mahad by 8-1 score to confirm their presence in the final of the event.', {'entities': []}), ('strong>MUMBAI: The International Cricket Council\'s anti-corruption unit has prevented a potential spot-fixing scandal and is investigating an international team for alleged attempts to manipulate future matches, the chief of the unit has said.</strongWhile revealing news of the probe, ICC anti-corruption unit head Ronnie Flanagan would not disclose details of the case as members of the international side are still being investigated."It will be very difficult for me to talk about specific details about an ongoing case, but quite recently we have a reason to believe that members of a particular team have intentions to manipulate events in forthcoming matches," Flanagan told reporters in Mumbai ahead of the World Twenty20."This was an international team but I am not going to go into any details because it is still under our investigation."Certain individuals, we believed, had intention to manipulate events to facilitate betting on those events."', {'entities': []}), ('ISLAMABAD: Pakistan\'s car market has been dominated by Japanese automakers for decades, but a mini-economic revival looks set to attract new players from Europe and Korea into the mix.Despite heavy taxation on imported vehicles, enthusiasm for owning a car in Pakistan has remained undented \x96 thanks in part to underdeveloped public transport in the country´s sprawling cities, but also the social status it brings.Toyota, Suzuki and Honda car assembly plants already work around the clock in the southern port city of Karachi and eastern Lahore \x96 yet customers can still wait for up to four months for new vehicles to be delivered.Now demand for cars in the South Asian giant of 200 million people is accelerating even more quickly, as economic growth has reached its fastest pace since 2008 while renewed investor confidence and easing inflation have spurred consumer spending.Keen to cash in, a delegation from German auto giant Volkswagen visited the country in recent weeks, according to Pakistani officials and German diplomats.Company spokesman Christoph Adomat told AFP that while "Volkswagen is constantly evaluating market opportunities on a worldwide basis... there are no decisions for an investment from Volkswagen side in Pakistan".Miftah Ismail, the chairman of Pakistan Board of Investment who took part in the talks, said Volkswagen was not the only company expressing an interest.

The groundwork was laid during the course of his second-wicket stand of 107 with de Villiers before Daredevils hit back with a tremendous exhibition of late-overs bowling courtesy the returning Mohammed Shami and Chris Morris, who conceded only 27 off the last four overs.Daredevils were dealt an early blow when Shreyas Iyer was dismissed by Shane Watson but it had little effect on de Kock as he pierced a packed off-side field for three fours off the offspinner Parvez Rasool in the second over.De Kock was particularly punishing through the off side, a majority of his runs coming behind square. Once he was set, the other elements to his game surfaced. A nonchalant flick off Harshal Patel in the ninth over soared over deep square leg, and once he was into the 90s he used the pace to scoop the ball over short fine leg. The end result was a wagon wheel with spokes all around the wicket.De Kock's sparkling form helped Daredevils ride a trough when Sanju Samson struggled to play his shots, but his dismissal in the sixth over turned their fortunes. Nair and de Kock got stuck in against Yuzvendra Chahal, Harshal Patel and David Wiese, whose combined tally at one point was 78 conceded off seven overs.

"America should thank God for him. He was an American hero."From the turmoil of civil rights and black Muslim movements of the 1960s to the darkest days after Sept. 11, 2001, Ali was a hero that U.S. Muslims could share with part of the American mainstream.Muslims remembered Ali for many familiar reasons, hailing him as a champion of social justice, a lifelong supporter of charitable works and an opponent of the U.S. war in Vietnam.Moreover, they said, he was a Muslim that a largely Christian country came to admire, even if Ali shocked and scared much of U.S. society after he joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name from Cassius Clay in 1964."When we look at the history of the African-American community, one important factor in popularizing Islam in America is Muhammad Ali," Warith Deen Mohammed II, son of the former Nation of Islam leader, said in a statement.With some 3.3 million adherents in the United States, Muslims make up about 1 percent of the population, largely immigrants and African-Americans who have embraced the religion.Although they have integrated into society better than some of their brethren in Europe, American Muslims face hardships even as the United State grows demographically less white and less Christian.Since 2001, they have suffered backlash from those Americans who equate all Muslims with those who have attacked civilians out of some jihadist cause.Decades before, black Muslim leaders such as Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X rattled the white establishment as religious and ethnic minorities who demanded equality for their people. Elijah Mohammad preached a version that denounced white oppression and opposed integration of the races.Ali came to be widely revered, but there was a time when he was rejected, mostly by whites by also by some black leaders for his bold statements against white supremacy and for his refusal to embrace the model epitomized by Martin Luther King, a Christian."The sanitizing of Ali\'s image in recent years has led many to forget that he was reviled by many during the 1960s for his conversion to Islam and for his refusal to be inducted into the U.S. armed forces," said Frank Guridy, a visiting associate professor of history at Columbia University."He was seen as a traitor to the United States of America."In the 1970s, Ali converted to Sunni Islam, the largest denomination among Muslims worldwide, and embraced Sufism, a mystical school of the faith.At the gathering of Muslim-American leaders in Washington, speaker after speaker remembered him fondly as the Muslim who Americans came to love.Ali defended Muslims last December, after Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump proposed temporarily stopping Muslims from entering the country in the wake of militant attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California."Our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam, and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people\'s views on what Islam really is," Ali said in a statement.He also used his influence to advocate the release of Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who spent 18 months in a Iranian prison, and for Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter who was captured by extremists in Pakistan and later beheaded in 2002."Muhammad Ali was a gift from God," said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, "not only to Muslims but to the world."', {'entities': []}), ('strong>BENAULIM, India: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are set to seal energy and defence deals Saturday that officials say are signs of a deepening partnership between the nations.</strongPutin will hold talks with Modi after arriving in the Indian tourism state of Goa for a BRICS summit also involving the heads of leading emerging nations Brazil, China and South Africa.Among the agreements expected to be signed between the two leaders are Moscow´s delivery of its most advanced anti-aircraft defence system to India.India, the world´s top defence importer, is undergoing a $100-billion upgrade of its Soviet-era military hardware, as it looks to protect its borders from arch-rival Pakistan and an increasingly assertive China.Modi and Putin will also focus on strengthening energy ties to meet India´s growing thirst for fuel and electricity for its fast-growing economy.Russia´s biggest oil company Rosneft is expected to acquire India´s Essar Oil in a multi-billion-dollar deal, according to local media reports, quoting officials involved in the agreement."The menu is vast," India´s ambassador to Russia, Pankaj Saran said at a briefing on the talks, without detailing the deals to be signed."It is more than a relationship, it is a partnership and very justifiably it has been described by the two leaders as both special and privileged, as well as of course strategic," he said."It is very deep and very intense and it is poised to grow even further."Saran said he also expected them to discuss India´s tensions with neighbour Pakistan, which spiked after last month´s attack on an Indian army base that killed 19 soldiers.Modi has sought to isolate Pakistan internationally since the attack that India blamed on Pakistan-based militants.India said it subsequently carried out strikes against militants over the border in Pakistan, prompting a furious response from Islamabad."We have conveyed our views to the Russian side.

Cotton is the largest component of that total.It is not clear whether other goods and commodities traded between the two, such as jewellery and dry fruits, have been hit by the escalation in hostilities as well, but the disruption to cotton shipments is potentially significant.In the crop year ended Sept. 30, Pakistan was India\'s biggest cotton buyer after its own crop was hit by drought and whitefly pest.It imported 2.5 million bales from India, and supported Indian cotton prices at a time when China was cutting imports, traders said.Lower purchases by Pakistan this year could hurt exports from the world\'s biggest producer of the fibre and put pressure on Indian prices, but could also help rival cotton suppliers like Brazil, the United States and some African countries.Chirag Patel, chief executive officer of Indian exporter Jaydeep Cotton Fibers, said the country could export 5 million bales in the 2016/17 crop year, but exports could plunge to 3 million bales without Pakistani imports.An exporter based in Mumbai estimated that Pakistan will need to import at least 3 million bales in 2016/17, and India will have a surplus of around 8 million bales."As soon as the (political) situation improves, cotton trade will definitely resume between the two countries," said Haq of the Pakistan Cotton Dealers Association.But for now, traders on both sides of the border said the environment was not conducive to doing business."Many cotton exporters are not interested in selling cotton to Pakistan.

For the week, it fell 76 cents, or nearly 2 percent, its first decline in six weeks.Despite the stumble, oil prices remain about 50 percent higher from multi-year lows hit in January from glut worries. While declining US oil output and strong gasoline demand were responsible for some of that recovery, the bulk of it was powered by major producers\' plans to freeze output at January\'s highs.While this week\'s drop of oil 15 rigs was not a game changer to the market, it offered a reprieve to worries that there was a daily glut of some two million barrels in crude."After last week\'s increase of one rig, some may have assumed that the continuing decrease in rig counts was finally abating," said Pete Donovan, broker at Liquidity Futures in New York.

next 15 years, including subsidy cuts, tax rises, sales of state assets, a government efficiency drive and efforts to spur private sector investment.The IMF had for years been urging Saudi Arabia to adopt many of those measures, and in a statement on Thursday it said the reform plan aimed for "an appropriately bold and far-reaching transformation of the Saudi Arabian economy"."The supporting policies that will be announced in the coming months are expected to set out how these goals will be achieved," IMF official Tim Callen said after leading a team to Saudi Arabia this month for annual consultations with the Fund."To ensure their success, the reforms will need to be properly prioritized and sequenced, and the appropriate pace of implementation carefully assessed."Riyadh has been cutting spending and trying to raise fresh revenues as it grapples with its budget deficit, which totaled $98 billion in 2015. The IMF predicted the deficit would stay very large this year, at about 14 percent of gross domestic product compared to 16 percent last year.But it welcomed the government\'s spending controls and changes to domestic energy prices announced last December, saying: "Fiscal policy is appropriately adjusting to the drop in oil prices."

The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody´s said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt "will further strain Pakistan\'s budget and balance of payments, a credit negative". "Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector\'s progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan\'s financial support program with the International Monetary Fund."The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody´s, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan\'s rating outlook from "negative" to "stable" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a "key driver" in its decision last year. "Circular debt" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country´s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody´s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. "The government´s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections," it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on Pakistan´s import bill, it added.                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', {'entities': []}), ('strong>ISLAMABAD: Iran has offered to provide modern buses to improve public transport in Pakistan, especially in Sindh province.</strongAccording to Radio Tehran report, Iranian Consul General Mehdi Sobhani made the offer in a meeting with Sindh Minister for Transport and Mass Transit Nasir Hussain Shah.The minister lauded the CG for offering assistance in various transport-related projects and offering to provide 200 modern buses to improve public transport in the city.He said provision of a modern transport system to the people was a priority of the government and efforts were underway on various projects in this regard.The Iranian diplomat also invited the minister to bring along officials of the transport department to Iran on an exposure visit to witness the modern urban transport system operating in Tehran.', {'entities': []}), ('HONG KONG:  Hong Kong shares opened 0.66 percent lower Monday following a tepid lead from Wall Street, as the first full week of the new year kicked off.The benchmark Hang Seng Index dipped 158.63 points to 23,699.19. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', {'entities': []}), ('London: World oil prices rose Thursday on the back of the weaker dollar, but gains were capped after US crude reserves swelled again to a record high.In midday London deals, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery advanced 82 cents to $58.36 a barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April added 52 cents to $48.69 a barrel."Despite the bearish oil inventories report yesterday, crude oil prices rebounded in early trade this morning supported by a slightly softer US dollar," said Sucden brokers analyst Myrto Sokou on Thursday."Brent futures recovered and climbed higher towards $59 per barrel while WTI futures rose above $48.50 per barrel."The weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated crude cheaper for buyers using stronger currencies, which tends to stimulate demand and prices.Crude futures had finished mixed Wednesday after a key report showed US crude stockpiles had struck another record high, adding to an oversupplied global market.The US Department of Energy said crude oil inventories surged by 4.5 million barrels in the week to March 6 to 448.9 million.That was the highest level since the beginning of the weekly data series in 1982.Crude prices lost some 60 percent of their value to decline to about $40 between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and the strong dollar.Prices have since rebounded somewhat following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Elsewhere, investors were monitoring the progress of talks between the United States and other major Western powers and Iran on Tehran´s contested nuclear programme as a deadline at the end of March nears.The Islamic republic has been crippled by a series of UN and US sanctions, including on crude exports, aimed at bringing an end to its nuclear drive, which the West says is being used to develop atomic weapons.

Many of these countries have allowed their currencies to depreciate primarily to maintain their trade competitiveness against China.

These estimates did not include the bidding proceeds, he made it clear.The DTH service, he said, was a state-of-the art technology offering new dimensions of distribution system and a wide range of choice to consumers. \x93The current analogue distribution system is offering a maximum of 80 channels while the DTH would increase the capacity to around 120 and each local DTH licence holder is expected to have at least 500,000 subscribers,\x94 said Absar Alam.Besides lucrative investment, the DTH regime would also make a significant contribution to job generation in the country leading to 15,000 jobs (5,000 by each company) i.e. new direct employment opportunities, he maintained.Absar Alam said the DTH service would not end the cable operators\x92 business, but would compel them to invest in technology and their distribution systems.However, the media watchdog issued non-exclusive licences for 15 years to the successful bidders after the open outcry bidding.Pakistani DTH services, once launched, will counter the sale of illegal Indian DTH services in Pakistan, which incur a heavy loss to the national exchequer because of transfer of between $200 million to $350 million to India annually on account of subscription fee. Now the legal DTH services will give consumers a choice against the current monopoly of cable operators as well.Pakistan has nearly 25 million electronic media subscribers and between three to five million consumers use Indian DTH illegally. After issuance of licences, subscribers of Indian DTH would have to shift to the local network.Similarly, foreign channels will get landing rights to come under the local regime through a regulatory process and launching of new local satellite channels will be allowed.The DTH licence holders will have to start operations within the year or risk termination of licences. The bidders are required to deposit 15 percent of the bid money at the outset of the bidding as earnest money, followed by 50 percent of the bid money upfront. The remaining amount could be paid immediately or in three yearly instalments at a mark-up rate.Each DTH licence holder is required to pay an annual fee of Rs10 million and contribute two percent of their gross revenue after the first three years of operations.Licenses to the bid winners would be awarded after clearance from the interior ministry and law enforcement agencies.', {'entities': []}), ('strong>TOKYO: The pound dived in early Asian trading Friday, tumbling from 2016 highs as initial results of Britain´s EU membership vote suggested the race was much closer than expected.</strongSterling dived to just below $1.43 from above $1.50 -- its highest this year -- while it dropped to 79.17 pence to the euro, from around 76 pence earlier Friday.', {'entities': []}), ('strong>WASHINGTON: The head of Japan\'s SoftBank Group Corp, which in October set up a $100 billion fund for technology investments, said on Tuesday he would invest $50 billion in U.S. businesses, a move President-elect Donald Trump claimed was a direct result of his election win.</strongThe investment, which could create 50,000 new U.S. jobs, revived speculation on Wall Street that U.S. telecommunications giant Sprint Corp, 82-percent-owned by SoftBank, might rekindle merger talks with T-Mobile US Inc that died under pressure from U.S. regulators.Trump\'s moves since the election to engage with individual companies, while turning his back on broader, years-in-the-works trade deals, show that the President-elect is leaning on the deal-making skills he honed in the boardroom. Trump campaigned against the overregulation of business and is expected to be more open to mergers than President Barack Obama.The investment announced Tuesday would come from the $100 billion investment fund SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is setting up with Saudi Arabia\x92s sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners, according to the Wall Street Journal.Trump made the announcement in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan where he met with the head of SoftBank, a $68 billion telecommunications and tech investment behemoth."Ladies and gentlemen, this is Masa from SoftBank of Japan, and he\x92s just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs," Trump said."He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!" Trump later Tweeted.Prior to the election, SoftBank said Saudi Arabia\'s Public Investment Fund (PIF) would be the lead partner in the fund and could invest up to $45 billion over the next five years. SoftBank expects to put in at least $25 billion. Several other large, unnamed investors are in talks on their participation and could bring the total size of the new fund up to $100 billion, SoftBank said.Son, who wore a red tie and red sweater under his suit jacket, told reporters his company would create jobs by investing in startup companies in the United States."We are going to invest $50 billion into the U.S. and commit to create 50,000 new jobs," Son said, adding that he saw a lot of "deregulation" under a Trump administration.Trump and Son did not give a timeline for the investment. Trump\'s four-year term will begin after his Jan. 20 inauguration.U.S.-listed shares of SoftBank gained 3 percent to $30.99.Son had hoped to merge Sprint with T-Mobile US to take on U.S. market leaders AT&amp;T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc.Shares of Sprint briefly reached their highest level in 2-1/2 years, soon after Son\'s comments. They closed up 1.5 percent to $8.17 in heavy trading, ending well below session highs. Shares of T-Mobile US were up 1.8 percent at $55.99.It was not immediately clear how much of SoftBank\'s investment had been disclosed before. Softbank said on Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. election, it planned to make future large-scale investments via the $100 billion tech fund, rather than on its own, to avoid growing already-bloated debt.Whether or not Trump\'s election led to SoftBank\'s planned investment, the billionaire\'s victory has been a boon to stock investors. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at another record level on Tuesday, its 11th new high since the Nov. 8 vote.Should the SoftBank fund grow as large as $100 billion, it would be one of the world\'s largest private equity investors and a potential kingpin in the technology sector.SoftBank has also been stepping up investment in new areas.
